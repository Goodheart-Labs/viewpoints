        internally and combined with data collected on our Website. We are also
        working closely with third parties (including, for example, business
        partners, suppliers, sub-contractors, advertising networks, analytics

        a) You have given consent to the processing of your personal data for
        one or more specific purposes;
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
        c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
        which we are subject;

      <li>
        d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
        pursued by us or by a third party such as our financial payments, except

      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.5 We may keep a record of those links which are used the most to enable
      us to provide the most helpful information but we agree to keep such
      information confidential and you will not be identified from this
      information.

      , and we will delete your data from our systems. However, you acknowledge
      this will limit our ability to provide the best possible services to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.7 In some cases, the collection of personal data may be a statutory or
      contractual requirement, and we will be limited in the{" "}

      </li>
      <li>
        b) Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a
        third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override
        those interests.
      </li>
      <li>
        c) Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, for
        example compliance with health and safety, tax or other statutory

      or sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or
      text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any
      time by contacting us at{" "}
